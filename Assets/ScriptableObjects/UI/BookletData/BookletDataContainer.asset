    Header: A Series
    Description: 'The new A Series cabinets build on the heritage of ADAM Audio and
      the AX Series in particular. In an evolutionary design, A Series cabinets have
      deeper beveling to further reduce diffraction. In addition, thicker baffle
      walls strengthen the cabinets and reduce internal vibrations. A dual-sided
      flared-port design optimizes airflow and helps reduce port noise. Overall the
      A Series design can provide lower extension and higher efficiency in a smaller
      box than other speakers. '
