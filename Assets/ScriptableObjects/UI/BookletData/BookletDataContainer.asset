    Header: Cabinet and Mounting
    Description: The new A Series cabinets build on the heritage of ADAM Audio and
      the AX Series in particular. In an evolutionary design, the deep beveling of
      the cabinets reduce diffraction while a sided flared-port optimizes airflow
      and reduces port noise. In addition, thicker baffle walls strengthen the cabinets
      and reduce internal vibrations. All A Series speakers include an underside
      mounting interface, allowing them to be securely mounted on walls, ceilings,
      or speaker stands.

    Header: Rotatable HPS Waveguide & X-ART Tweeter
    Description: "ADAM Audio HPS (High-frequency Propagation System) waveguide technology
      enables tweeters to disperse sound with controlled consistency that is broad
      in the horizontal axis but tightly focused in the vertical plane. The A Series
      waveguide is made from a new glass fiber polymer compound that helps create
      a clear sound, free of unwanted resonance. The entire module can be rotated
      in 90 degree steps to continue to benefit from HPS waveguide technology whether
      you position the speaker horizontally or vertically.\_The ADAM Audio X-ART
      (eXtended Accelerated Ribbon Technology) tweeter is at the heart of the waveguide.
      Handmade in Germany, the X-ART tweeter is powered by an analogue class AB amplifier
      and reproduces the finest sonic details with a precise transient response."

    Header: Dedicated Midrange Driver
    Description: Adapted from technology used in the flagship S Series speakers,
      the A Series midrange driver delivers a clean sound in a critical part of the
      frequency range where humans are especially sensitive to coloration of sound.
      Using a dedicated driver for the midrange further helps clarify lows and highs
      by eliminating the need for woofers and tweeters to reproduce midrange frequencies.
      Both the A77H and A8H models are three-way systems that use the A Series midrange
      driver, which is made from the same MLM material as the woofers.

    Header: Multi-Layer Mineral (MLM) Woofer
    Description: A Series woofers are constructed from layers of mineral stone fibers
      that have been baked together to create a lightweight but highly stable material
      that helps eliminate partial vibrations. By combining this material with a
      new magnet system, A Series woofers produce high output with low distortion,
      delivering a clean low-end. The MLM woofers are powered by an entirely new
      class D digital amplifier with facilitates the advanced feature set of the
      A Series.

    Header: Room Adaptation, Voicings, Remote Control & Room Correction
    Description: "The A Series capitalizes on the transformative power of DSP-based
      electronics to provide greater tuning precision and better predictability than
      analog-only speakers. There are four bands of room equalisation on the back
      panel, with each band adjustable in predefined steps to offer more than 100
      adaptation options. The back panel also features two selectable \u201CVoicings\u201D
      (signature ADAM AUDIO sound profiles) plus a third fully customisable option.
      The advanced DSP of the A Series can be controlled remotely and in real time
      using A Control, a dedicated software application that is available to download
      free of charge from adam-audio.com.\_Using A Control, advanced Room correction
      filters, including those from Sonarworks, can be pushed directly to an embedded
      platform on the monitors."
